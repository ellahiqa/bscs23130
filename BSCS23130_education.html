        <p>
            i've done my matric from pips with 1050 marks.i did my fsc from kips and decided to major in computer science from itu. ive always wanted to study computer science as a major since i studied it in highscholl and found it quite interesting. another reason why i decided to study computer science was because maths has always been my favourite subject.i've also taken alot of programming crash courses on youtube including HARVARD CS50.
